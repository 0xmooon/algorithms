Part of the coastline of the Island is home to a large population of crabs. Most of the time, these animals are under strict protection, but once a year, hunters from nearby villages organize a big hunt. Before the start, the Great Hunter designates a square hunting area, which is divided into a certain number of identical plots so that there are as many plots along the length of the square side as there are groups participating in the event.

The hunting area is oriented with respect to the cardinal directions, i.e. opposite walls indicate N-S or E-W directions. Hunters from each village set up their camp on one of the plots and go out in search of prey - following tradition - only in the 8 compass directions (N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW).
No camp of competing hunters can be on the same "hunting path": Islanders have mistakenly taken the limbs of sleeping companions for crabs in the past.
In addition, different locations on the beach have different characteristics. Some require hardening before setting up a camp, others must be equipped with anti-walrus barriers (a new Hunting Safety and Hygiene regulation has been in force since last year), and yet others simply yield little prey.
In this year's edition, the least expensive placement of the hunters' camps was to be ensured by Ada and Serweryn, who were promised a dozen or so pieces for building a crab-computer in return.

# Input:
The first line of input contains a number n, which is the number of camps that must be placed on a square hunting area with a side length of n plots. The next n lines contain sequences of n non-negative integers ai,j, where each number ai,j corresponds to the cost of building a camp on the field with coordinates i, j.

4 ≤ n ≤ 30

0 ≤ ai,j ≤ 100

# Output:
A sequence of n numbers representing the column numbers in which we will place the camps in successive rows in the least costly and correct placement. The displayed answer must be the smallest solution in lexicographic order.
